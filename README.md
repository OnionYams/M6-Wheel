# M6-Wheel

Simulation of Wheel of fortune with some alternate rules for 3 players(can be played by 1)

rules notes: players can buy vowels whenever during their turn, ie don't need to spin first

players spin for each consonant guess, and CAN spin the same value

only 19 instead of 24 wheel options, bankrupt, lose turn and 17 values 100 to 900 by 50, no duplicates

since the wheel is less harsh, there's no money that's immune. ie, you can use money from past round to buy vowels, but

bankrupts will make the player lose EVERYTHING

reward for winning round 1 or 2 is 1000 * the round

turn continues from where it left off, ie player 1 solves round 1, round 2 starts with player 2

lose your turn if you buy a wrong vowel, otherwise 1 person with bank just buys out everything

goes by player order for who plays round 3 if multiple people are tied

no time limit for final guess because that's a bit anticlimactic to lose to a clock
